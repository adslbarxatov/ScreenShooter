_Changes for v 3.2_:
- The application has been retargeted to `.NET Framework 4.8.1`;
- Access checking method has been completely rewritten: now it will properly detect problems with file / registry input / output and help user with fixing them;
- Added the special section in the user guide for access troubleshooting;
- Updated HypeHelp and Updates checker mechanics: this should fix apps freezing immediately after launch (on some PCs);
- App will now show the hotkeys list at the first start (in addition to the user guide)
